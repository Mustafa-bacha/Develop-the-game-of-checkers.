# Checkers Game

This is a console-based implementation of the game Checkers in C++. The game follows the standard rules of Checkers, where two players take turns moving their pieces on an 8x8 grid. The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so that they cannot make any moves.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of the Checkers game includes the following key components:

1. `Piece` Class:
   - Attributes:
     - `Player`: Represents the player who owns the piece (Red or White).
     - `LocationX` and `LocationY`: Stores the current position of the piece on the game board.
     - `IsKing`: Indicates whether the piece has been kinged.
     - Additional attributes as per your requirements.
   - Functions:
     - `TakeMove`: Handles the movement of the piece on the board.
     - `ValidateMove`: Checks if a given move is valid for the piece.
     - Additional functions as per your requirements.

2. Game Board:
   - The game board is represented as a 2D array, where each element corresponds to a square on the 8x8 grid.
   - Each square can hold a `Piece` object if occupied, or it can be empty.
   - The board is displayed to the players after each move.

## Constraints

- The implementation must use classes to represent the game entities.
- Each piece on the board should be an instance of the `Piece` class.
- The `Piece` class should have attributes such as `Player`, `LocationX`, `LocationY`, `IsKing`, etc.
- The `Piece` class should have functions like `TakeMove`, `ValidateMove`, and any additional functions as per your requirements.
- The game board should be displayed as a 2D array, showing the current positions of the pieces.
- The implementation should handle both valid and invalid moves, providing appropriate error messages when necessary.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable file generated.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
5. Enter your moves based on the prompts provided.
6. The game will display the board after each move, and you can continue playing until there is a winner or a draw.
7. You can resign or agree to a draw during the game.

## Note

- The code is implemented in C++ and may require a C++ compiler to build and run.
- Make sure to provide valid input when prompted to avoid unexpected behavior.
- If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact.
